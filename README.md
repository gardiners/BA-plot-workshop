This workshop was presented to the Cell & Molecular Therapies journal club at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital on 14 April 2021. The presentation slides are best viewed at <https://gardiners.github.io/BA-plot-workshop/>.

This repo builds a Xaringan presentation. As well as the presentation, it includes a script that may be useful for extracting point data from an SVG file. For this workshop, the script was used to extract data from a published PDF plot, after some cleaning in Inkscape. See [extract_points.R](extract_points.R).
